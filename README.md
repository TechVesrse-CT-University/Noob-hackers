## 🌟 Problem Statement
In traditional healthcare systems, patient records are often:
  1. Scattered across multiple providers (hospitals, clinics, labs).
  2. Stored in centralized databases, making them vulnerable to data breaches.
  3. Prone to tampering, loss, and lack of proper traceability.
  4. Difficult to access across institutions, especially during emergencies or transfers.
  5. Not fully owned or controlled by patients, despite being about their health.
These challenges create barriers in delivering timely, coordinated, and patient-centric care.

## 💡 Our Solution
We present a Blockchain-Based Healthcare Management System that uses blockchain to securely store and manage patient health records in a decentralized, tamper-proof, and transparent manner.
Key Features:
  🔐 Immutability: Once added, medical records cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring data integrity.
  🌍 Decentralized Access: Authorized entities (doctors, labs, insurance providers) can access data without depending on a central authority.
  👥 Patient-Centric Ownership: Patients control access to their records through cryptographic keys and smart contracts.
  🧾 Auditability: Every transaction and access to medical data is logged and traceable.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [DFX](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/install-upgrade-remove) (DFINITY Canister SDK v0.12.0 or higher)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (for backend development)
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) (Rust package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Health-Management.git
   cd Health-Management
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the local Internet Computer replica**:
   ```bash
   dfx start --background
   ```

4. **Deploy the canisters to the local replica**:
   ```bash
   dfx deploy
   ```

5. **Open the application**:
   Once deployed, the terminal will display a URL (typically http://localhost:4943?canisterId=...). Open this URL in your browser.

## 💻 Development

### Frontend Development

The frontend code is located in the `src/Health-Management-frontend` directory.

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   cd src/Health-Management-frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start a development server at http://localhost:8080 with hot-reloading.

2. **Build the frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This creates optimized production files in the `dist` folder.

### Backend Development

The backend code is located in the `src/healthchain_backend` directory.

1. **Modify the Rust canister code** in `src/healthchain_backend/src/lib.rs`

2. **Update the Candid interface** after making changes:
   ```bash
   npm run generate
   ```

3. **Redeploy the backend**:
   ```bash
   dfx deploy healthchain_backend
   ```

### Key Files and Directories

- `src/Health-Management-frontend/src/component/` - React components
- `src/Health-Management-frontend/src/App.tsx` - Main application component
- `src/healthchain_backend/src/lib.rs` - Rust canister implementation
- `dfx.json` - Project configuration for Internet Computer

## 📤 Deployment

### Local Deployment

To deploy the application to the local replica:

```bash
dfx deploy
```

### Internet Computer Mainnet Deployment

1. **Create a cycles wallet** if you don't have one:
   ```bash
   dfx identity --network ic new-wallet
   ```

2. **Ensure you have sufficient cycles** in your wallet.

3. **Deploy to the Internet Computer mainnet**:
   ```bash
   dfx deploy --network ic
   ```

4. **Access your deployed application** at the URL provided in the deployment output.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The Health Management System follows a client-server architecture built on the Internet Computer:

- **Frontend**: React application that provides the user interface
- **Backend**: Rust canisters that handle data storage, retrieval, and business logic
- **Authentication**: Internet Identity for secure, anonymous authentication
- **Storage**: Internet Computer canisters for immutable, secure data storage

### Data Flow

1. User authenticates via Internet Identity
2. Frontend communicates with backend canisters via Candid interface
3. Backend stores and retrieves data from canisters
4. Updates are propagated to the frontend in real-time

#### Security Policy Warnings

If you see warnings about security policies, create a `.ic-assets.json5` file in the project root:

```json
[
  {
    "match": "**/*",
    "security_policy": "standard"
  }
]
```

Welcome to your new `Health-Management` project and to the Internet Computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with `Health-Management`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Rust Canister Development Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/)
- [ic-cdk](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk)
- [ic-cdk-macros](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk-macros)
- [Candid Introduction](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/candid/)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd Health-Management/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
